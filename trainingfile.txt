We will heal. We will cure.

I channel Will Ferrel when I’m at the daddy daughter dances
Life is the ultimate gift
So many of us need so much less than we have especially when so many of us are in need
I hear people say ... this person is cool and this person is not cool... people are cool... man has never invented anything as awesome as a an actual person but sometimes we value the objects we create over life itself
I was just speaking with someone that told me their life story and they used to be homeless      We must and will cure homelessness and hunger   We have the capability as a species
We as a people will heal. We will insure the well being of each other
There are people sleeping in parking lots
We will cure hunger

Inflammation:
    -   Analogy of white blood cell    (protectors) rushing to the site of injury, fortification, rallying in support
